# Credit-EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit risk dataset to identify patterns, trends, and factors that influence loan repayment. Includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights for better credit risk assessment.

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview  
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a **credit risk dataset** to understand borrower behavior and identify patterns that can help financial institutions minimize loan default risk.  

The analysis includes:  
-  Handling missing values and outliers  
-  Exploring distributions of numerical and categorical variables  
-  Visualizing relationships between features and loan repayment status  
-  Identifying key factors that differentiate defaulters from non-defaulters  
-  Generating insights that can guide future predictive modeling  

The project follows a structured approach with raw data, processed data, Jupyter notebooks, and scripts for reproducibility.
