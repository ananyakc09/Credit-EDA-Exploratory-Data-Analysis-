# Credit-EDA-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit risk dataset to identify patterns, trends, and factors that influence loan repayment. Includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights for better credit risk assessment.

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a credit risk dataset to understand borrower behavior and identify patterns that can help financial institutions minimize loan default risk.

The analysis includes:
🔹 Handling missing values and outliers
🔹 Exploring distributions of numerical and categorical variables
🔹 Visualizing relationships between features and loan repayment status
🔹 Identifying key factors that differentiate defaulters from non-defaulters
🔹 Generating insights that can guide future predictive modeling

The project follows a structured approach with raw data, processed data, Jupyter notebooks, and scripts for reproducibility.
